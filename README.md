## Welcome to Komodian, an Unofficial Komodo Platform Community

## About Komodian
On 24 November 2021 several Komodo Platform community members started a discussion thread with an interest to start an unnoffical Komodo Platform community, with the intent of doing community driven marketing for Komodo and it's ecosystem projects. Because collectively Komodo Platform ecosytem is stronger, together. Out of these discussion came to existance **Komodian**, which was mentioned in Komodo Platform Discord chat group numerous times referring to all Komodo Ecosystem users (citizens) as Komodians.

The first identified task was to make a release of AtomicDEX-Desktop application without any Geo-Blocking and any other restrictions added to the application on some assets and cryptocurrencies tradablity within AtomicDEX application.

## Inviation to whole Komodo Platform Ecosystem communities
This Unofficial Komodo Community is still in the plans and we invite whole Komodo Platform Ecosystem to be part of this effort, to help raise awareness of the small yet rich Komodo Platform ecosytem. We have great independent projects evolving in Komodo Platform Ecosystem out of which few notable like [Verus](https://verus.io/), [Pirate Chain](https://pirate.black/), [Marmara Credit Loops](https://marmara.io/), [Tokel Platform](https://tokel.io/), [Chips](https://chips.cash/) and probably more.

## Community Software
Since official AtomicDEX application has legal liabilities attached to it's open source code, the first agenda on Unofficial Komodo Community was to make a release of AtomicDEX without any restrictions or boundations. So, Komodian made a fork (copy) of AtomicDEX-Desktop's latest codebase from Komodo Platform and made a release without any restrictions in it.
