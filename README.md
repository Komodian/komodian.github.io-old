## Welcome to Komodian Community

## About Komodian
On 24 November 2021 several Komodo Platform community members started a discussion thread with an interest to start a community with the intent of doing community driven marketing for Komodo and it's ecosystem projects. Because the Komodo Platform ecosystem is stronger together. Out of these discussions came into existence, **Komodian**. The name was mentioned in the Komodo Platform Discord chat group numerous times referring to all Komodo Ecosystem users (citizens) as Komodians.

The first identified task was to make a release of the AtomicDEX-Desktop application without any Geo-Blocking or any other restrictions added to the application on some assets and cryptocurrencies tradablity within AtomicDEX application.

## Invitation to all Komodo Platform Ecosystem communities
This community-led effort is still in the planning phase and we invite the whole Komodo Platform Ecosystem to be part of this effort, to help raise awareness of the small yet rich Komodo Platform ecosytem. We have great independent projects evolving in the ecosystem with a few notable projects like [Verus](https://verus.io/), [Pirate Chain](https://pirate.black/), [Marmara Credit Loops](https://marmara.io/), [Tokel Platform](https://tokel.io/), [Chips](https://chips.cash/) and many more.

## Community Software
Since the official AtomicDEX application has legal liabilities attached to it's open source code, the first agenda on community-led efforts was to make a release of AtomicDEX without any restrictions or boundaries. So, Komodian made a fork (copy) of AtomicDEX-Desktop's latest codebase from Komodo Platform and released it without any restrictions.
